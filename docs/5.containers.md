# Overview

A bit of a deep diver into some of the standard (useful) container types, like vectors and maps (associative arrays). Good stuff that's crucial for any worthwhile programme.

* Options for collecting the results of vector operations safely
  * [vector_collect.rs](../5.containers/vector_collect.rs)
* Maps (associative arrays / dicts)
  * [maps.rs](../5.containers/maps.rs)
* Sets
  * [sets.rs](../5.containers/sets.rs)
* Building a CLI tool
  * Did not run this section - it goes too far into something I do not need to work with at this stage.
