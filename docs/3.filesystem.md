# Overview

Re-visiting file operations with more controlled operations like buffered reading and writing, versus the way it was handled in the first section.

For all work, the test file being read is `3.filesystem/read_me.fna`, containing the content:

```
>seq_1
ATCGATCG
ATCGATCG
>seq_2
TTGGCCAA
NNAATTCC
```

* [Buffered file reading and writing](../3.filesystem/buffered_reader.rs)
  * This skips the creation of a struct to fake a line-by-line iterator. It's easy enough to work around this use case.
* [Files, paths, and directories](../3.filesystem/paths_and_directories.rs)
* [Processes](../3.filesystem/processes.rs)
