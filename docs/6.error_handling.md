# Overview

A more comprehensive look into error handling in `rust` and how to properly handle the `Result<>` container. At times there may be a file read for the example.

* Basic handling when a function can raise multiple errors.
  * [basic_handling.rs](../6.error_handling/basic_handling.rs)]
  * This example takes the first command line argument as a file name to read, if sepcified, or defaults to reading `R_multiflora.fna` if nothing is provided.
* Useful crates to extend error handling functionality
  * [simple_error.rs](../6.error_handling/simple_error.rs)
