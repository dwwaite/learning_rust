# Learning rust!

I started out working in `rust` going by [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), but I found that the structure was hard to follow - too many instances where a concept from many chapters later would be introduced and just glossed over. If I read ahead to get the concept, I then found myself reading content that had come in chapters between where I was and where I had jumped to (understandably).

Trying a new tutorial ([here](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/)) for a more example-driven approach.
