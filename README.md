# Learning rust!

I started out working in `rust` going by [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), but I found that the structure was hard to follow - too many instances where a concept from many chapters later would be introduced and just glossed over. If I read ahead to get the concept, I then found myself reading content that had come in chapters between where I was and where I had jumped to (understandably).

Trying a new tutorial ([here](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/)) for a more example-driven approach.

## Contents

1. [Basics](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/1-basics.html)
   * Starting out without `cargo`, instead just using `rustc` to compile simple source code.
   * This is already much nicer for this stage, as it makes stashing these outputs much simpler and keeps `git` cleaner.
   * Covering concepts such as:
     * Macros
     * Assert statement
     * Conditionals
     * Mutability and data types (implicit assignment and explicit casting)
     * Pass-by-reference and dereferencing
     * Imports and using the `rustup doc` command
     * Arrays and slices, and unwrapping `Option` types

Currently up to [here](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/1-basics.html#vectors).
