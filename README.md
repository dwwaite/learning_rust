# Learning rust!

This is just my private repo working my way through the Rust By Example documentation.

There is rough mapping of the exercises I have created with the documentation:

* 1.rust_structs
  * [2.3 Arrays and Slices](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/primitives/array.html)
